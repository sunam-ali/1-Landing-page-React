## About the Project

This is my first project using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, aimed at learning the fundamentals of React and modern front-end development. The project focuses on:

- Breaking down to **reusable components**
- Using **JSX** to structure UI
- Passing Props
- Managing component state with **useState**
- Rendering lists dynamically with **map**
- Understanding **folder structure** and Component hierarchy.
- Applying **Tailwind CSS** for responsive design

The app itself is a **mock tool for VR app development**, giving users an idea of how VR projects can be structured and developed.
